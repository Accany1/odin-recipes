    <h3>Nutter Butter Reindeer</h3>

    <p>As I was growing up, I saw my mom make dozen of different Christmas cookies.  One of my (many) favorites is chocolate dipped Nutter Butters!  Through the power of Pinterest, I have seen the dipped Nutter Butter evolve into all manner of holiday character, so this year I decided to take my little Nutter Butters and make them into cute little reindeer!</p>

    <p>This was also a very fun opportunity for my son to help in the kitchen!  He helped me by sorting through the M&M’s for the red ones.  He also put the M&M’s on the cookies and the eyes on the reindeer.  It is always fun to have my little mini foodie working by my side</p>
        
    <p>Oh, and if you have some extra chocolate left over, dip some caramels (I bought mine - I just love the ones from Kraft!) and sprinkle with a little sea salt.  Or dip the little pretzel remnants that are too small to be antlers--you can make the little ones snicker by calling it Reindeer Poop!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Nutter Butters (I used about ¾ of a package)</li>
        <li>½ cup pretzels, broken</li>
        <li>Red M&M’s</li>
        <li>White royal icing</li>
        <li>Mini chocolate chips</li>
        <li>8 oz semi sweet chocolate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Line cookie sheets with waxed paper and melt the chocolate in the microwave or double boiler. </li>
        <li>Dip each Nutter Butter in the chocolate until coated, draining off excess chocolate with a fork.  Set the coated cookies onto the prepared sheets.  Working quickly, add 2 pretzels for antlers and an M&M for a nose.  Set aside until the chocolate is cooled.</li>
        <li>Once the chocolate is set, pipe two white circles for the eyes.  Add a mini chocolate chip in the center for pupils.  Once the icing is dry, stack the cookies in a lidded container for storage.</li>
    </ol>
